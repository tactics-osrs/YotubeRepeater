# YotubeRepeater
This script takes your favorite YouTube video link and makes it play on repeat.
Simply input the URL of the video when prompted.

## Example
 For example, if your favorite video is at "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ", just enter that URL.
 The script will then open the video in a new window, playing on repeat.
